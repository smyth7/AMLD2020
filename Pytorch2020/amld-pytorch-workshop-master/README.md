This is a tutorial presented during a [workshop](https://appliedmldays.org/workshops/pytorch-tutorial) at the Applied Machine Learning Days 2020.

It consists of 6 interactive Jupyter notebooks.

# Notebooks

The links below open the notebooks in Google Colab. This way, you don't have to install anything on your computer and you get a GPU for free.

# Alternative setups

## Binder

Binder is an alterantive way to run remote notebooks that does not require a Google account.

## Running locally using Conda
If you want to run the notebooks locally, you can use `conda`. The following instructions
should work on Linux/Mac OS, Windows might require slight adaptations.

### Step 1: Install conda
If you have not installed it yet, you can download it from [Anaconda (Python 3.6 version)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux).

Verify that it is installed by running
```bash
conda -V
```

Make sure your conda installation is up-to-date:
```bash
conda update conda
```

#### Step 2: Download repository and install environment
Now clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theevann/amld-pytorch-workshop.git
cd amld-pytorch-workshop
```

The available `conda` environments can be listed using
```bash
conda env list
```

Let's now create a new environment called _'amld-pytorch'_.
```bash
conda env create -f environments.yml
```


#### Step 3: Activate/Deactivate the environment
After the environment has been created, you can **activate** it by
```bash
source activate amld-pytorch
```

Now start the Jupyter notebook by running
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

The environment can similarly **deactivated** by
```bash
source deactivate
```
