# A conceptual introduction to reinforcement learning

This workshop will introduce you to the basics of reinforcement learning. In order to do so, you will receive some theoretical background, as well as hands-on experience by implementing some RL algorithms yourself.

## Requirements
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Google account
- A laptop with a modern browser

## Getting started
This repository contains the Colab notebooks for the exercises during the workshop. [**You access these notebooks HERE**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LdTsKpXBrHsp1ijrOB88rQwzMJI2uS2Q).  

Open them either in playground mode (changes will not be saved), or save a copy to your Drive (`File` -> `Save a copy to Drive`). Make sure to be logged in with your Google account!  

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and open the notebooks using Colab: 
- Go to https://colab.research.google.com (make sure to be logged in with your Google account). Then go to 
- `File` -> `Open notebook` 
- Select the notebook you want to open
