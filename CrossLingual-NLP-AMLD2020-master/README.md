# CrossLingual-NLP-AMLD2020

**Run using jupyter notebook from top level - vscode will not render images otherwise**


Material for the hands-on workshop in the ["Applied Machine Learning Days at EPFL 2020"](https://appliedmldays.org/workshops/cross-lingual-natural-language-processing)

Authors:
- [Ioannis Partalas](https://ioannispartalas.github.io/about/)

## Setup
You should have installed the following python 3 packages:
```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
torch
umap-learn
seaborn
xgboost
```

In case you use Colab all these packages should be available. If it is not the case you can just use magic:
```bash
!pip install umap-learn torch seaborn
```

The notebooks use the [ConceptNet Numberbatch](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch) embeddings. We provide a script to download them and extract them. You can do this by: 
```bash
bash download_conceptNet.sh
```

You will need to install the [LASER](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER) library. To do so you can just run the following bash script:
```bash
bash install_laser.sh
```

Finally, download the dataset that we will use during the workshop:

## Structure of the workshop
The workshop structure is as follows:

1. Brief introduction in text classification: [Intro](https://github.com/ioannispartalas/CrossLingual-NLP-AMLD2020/blob/master/notebooks/AMLD%20Intro.ipynb) 
2. Introduction in cross-lingual word embeddings: [Cross-lingual word embeddings intro](https://github.com/ioannispartalas/CrossLingual-NLP-AMLD2020/blob/master/notebooks/Brief_into_to_Cross_Lingual_embeddings.ipynb) 
3. Cross-lingual document classification:
    1. [Zero-shot learning.](https://github.com/ioannispartalas/CrossLingual-NLP-AMLD2020/blob/master/notebooks/Cross-lingual%20document%20classification.ipynb)
    2. Few-shot learning and fine tuning.

## Exercises
1. Repeat the experiments for various language pairs
2. Add hyper-parameter tuning
3. Repeat the experiments with other embeddings (e.g., [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE), [Ferreira et al.](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~afm/projects/multilingual_embeddings.html), etc..)
4. For the target language use another domain
5. Explore the world of Transformers (BERT etc.). You can take a look at [huffingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
