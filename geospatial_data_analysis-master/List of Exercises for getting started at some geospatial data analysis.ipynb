    "## Intro\n",
    "* What is a Latitude? What is a Longitude?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does a GPS works? When can the signal becomes bad? Where are the main places of poor GPS signal inside a city?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to Google maps, click at some random points to get their lat/lon. Can you plot theses points here in the notebook? Minimum 2. (Take a look at [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the Haversine Distance? What is the Vincenty distance? What is the difference between them both intuitively? (not mathematically)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot a line between two points from before in Folium. Use a pop-up in one of the points to show the Haversine and Vincenty distance between the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/) dataset about taxi trips in New York and selecting one month of data (any). \n",
    "* Do we have any problematic data? i.e., that needs preprocessing somehow? (Here's a data analysis [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/breemen/nyc-taxi-fare-data-exploration) for some examples)\n",
    "* How could you make a rule for trip outliers? (Percentiles? IQR? Geographic boundary?)\n",
    "* What is the average haversine distance for all trips? \n",
    "* Average haversine distance for each day of the week (use pandas groupby) - do **not** use `for` loop's\n",
    "* Considering a price of 1.5 dollars/km, what is the average revenue for each day of the week?\n",
    "* Which day of the week had more revenue?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Spatial Aggregation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at [H3](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) and plot the data into [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/). In the map, hexagons with more # of pick-ups should have a different color (heatmap).\n",
    "* What is H3? Why do we need it **when aggregating** data?\n",
    "* Plot 10 drop off hotspots for trips that happened between 07:00 to 10:00 and another map plotting 10 drop off hotspots for trips that happened between 17:00 to 20:00\n",
    "* Can you think a way to find out (approximately) the 3 most popular taxi routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Working with Polygons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the zip codes for NY ([link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/download/i8iw-xf4u/application%2Fzip)). \n",
    "* Read the file (shapefile format) as a [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) dataframe.\n",
    "    * What is Geopandas? What's the difference between Geopandas and Pandas dataframes?\n",
    "* Print the polygons (simple print(df))\n",
    "* Read about [spatial joins](http://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html). What is the purpose of this? \n",
    "    * Perform a spatial join between the set of points in the exercise above (by their pickup location) and their corresponding ZIP codes polygon. The newly Dataframe should have the same number of rows of the previous df but with an extra **column** containing the ZIP code polygon definition.\n",
    "* Count the number of rows per ZIP code polygon. Result Dataframe should be 2 colums: \"ZIP Code Polygon\" and \"Count\".\n",
    "* Import file to Kepler.gl and visualize the polygons and color then by the count of trips  \n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **OPTIONAL**: Geopandas is actually not fast for spatial operations ([Reference](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2017/09/21/accelerating-geopandas-1)). For that, when working with hundreds of thousands of rows, we can create a spatial index before hand.   \n",
    "You can look at spatial indices such as R-Tree [Ref. 1](http://toblerity.org/rtree/) [Ref. 2](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/10/r-tree-spatial-index-python/) or [Quad-Tree](https://pypi.org/project/smartquadtree/) and mainly [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_95bSEqMzUA&t=327s) video. Can you explain them? Can you use them with the spatial join above?"

    "* Configure a pipenv file with the packages used until now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we need something than a pure `pip install`. Just pipenv won't work. For instance, if you look at [H3 Installation Guide](https://pypi.org/project/h3/), you'll see that it needs some C compilers prepared beforehand. In this case, someone with H3 **and** C compilers not installed wouldn't be able to install it, even with the pipenv. In this case, docker is a even better choice, more complicated though.  \n",

    "If speed between two GPS points is > X Km/h, we assume it's a wrong point and delete it. It's fast and efficient, but we might be missing to detect other more subtle outliers. I think a suitable case here to be data driven is to use [Kalman Filters](http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-kalman-filters-work/) so we don't have to define God constants in the filtering, *i.e.*, if distance bigger than random number, like 10 km, then outlier.  \n",
