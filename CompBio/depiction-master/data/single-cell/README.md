# Single-cell

Dataset from [Levine et al.](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00637-6).
The data consist of approximately 80K single cells, where the abundance of 13 cell surface markers was measured by mass cytometry.
In this dataset the existing cell subpopulations are well-characterized by manual gating.
The dataset is composed by:

- `data.csv`, the makers expression with the subpopulation label.
- `metadata.csv`, the mapping between the label and the actual cell type.
