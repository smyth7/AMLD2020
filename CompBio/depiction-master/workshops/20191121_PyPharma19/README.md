# Tutorial on interpretability in machine learning for Computational Biology

## Location

### Venue

[University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/de), Biozentrum, [Klingelbergstrasse 70](https://goo.gl/maps/51YhnLf5YLDBEjMY8), CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland


### Room

Seminarraum 104

## Requirements

This course is designed for everyone who would like to learn the basics of interpretability techniques for machine learning. The tutorial will provide a brief introduction to key concepts and recent developments in the field of interpretability.  **Participants who want to participate in the hands-on exercises should bring a laptop.**

### Setup

We provide 3 ways to follow the exercises.

1. _Docker_. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/dl-interpretability-compbio#docker-setup).
2. _Conda environment_. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/dl-interpretability-compbio#development-setup).
3. [Notebook](https://github.com/IBM/dl-interpretability-compbio/blob/master/workshops/20191121_PyPharma19/tutorial_colab.ipynb) that should work out-of-the-box on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (with some caveats). 

We personally suggest the first setup (docker). 

For both the _docker_ and the _conda_ setup, **we strongly suggest to setup your machine prior to the tutorial (ideally the day before)** following the linked instructions. Should you incur into any issue, please do not hesitate to contact [Jannis](mailto:jab@zurich.ibm.com) or [myself](mailto:uye@zurich.ibm.com).
